# Practical Deductive Verification of OCaml Programs

A tutorial on the use of the Cameleer tool and the Gospel
specification language to reason about programs written in the OCaml
language.

We show how to deductively verify the correctness of OCaml programs,
ranging from simple purely-functional implementations to imperative
programs mixing mutable effects and exceptions. In particular, this
tutorial includes the following examples/exercises:

  1. A merge routine for functional lists.
  2. Finding an element within an array.
  3. A functional implementation of the *same fringe* problem.
  4. The Boyre-Moore MJRTY algorithm.
